MercadoLibra wants to know if analyzing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. So, find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

* Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic

* Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality

* Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns

* Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet

## Results

beyond approximately 80 datas for the available data

year (lowest before November), time of day (midnight highest) and day of week with
an extremely positive trend from Monday to Tuesday, tapering off through
Sunday.
